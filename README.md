# JavaIntern-KovanLabs
This repository contains my Java and Spring Boot practice code developed during my internship and MCA coursework, focusing on clean architecture, RESTful APIs, and backend fundamentals.

# Java Practice Repository

This repository contains structured Java practice programs developed as part of my
learning, internship preparation, and MCA coursework.

The code is organized topic-wise to maintain clarity and readability, rather than
randomly grouped files.

## Folder Structure

- **collections/**  
  Programs demonstrating Java Collections Framework concepts such as List, Set, Map,
  and iteration techniques.

- **fileIO/**  
  Examples covering basic file handling using character streams.

- **fileIOByteStream/**  
  Programs focused on byte stream operations in Java.

- **java8/**  
  Practice code related to Java 8 features such as lambda expressions and streams.

- **shoppingKartInJava/**  
  A simple console-based Java application implementing core OOP concepts,
  exception handling, and basic usage of Java Collections

## Purpose

- Strengthen core Java fundamentals
- Practice clean and organized code structure
- Share progress with mentors for review and feedback

## Notes
- This repository focuses on clarity and learning, not production-ready applications.
- Each folder contains topic-specific examples for better understanding.
